# Alexa Skill Test Robustness README

This Visual Studio Code extension facilitates the robustness testing of Alexa skills by providing an integrated web user interface for selecting, editing, and generating test phrases from seeds through two specialized panels: the Generate Panel and the Testing Panel.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Seed Selection**: Users can select or deselect seed phrases using checkboxes in the generate panel. By default, all seeds are selected.

- **Seed Editing**: Seeds can be edited by clicking on the "Edit" button in the generate panel, allowing users to customize the seeds before generating phrases.

- **Specialized Testing**: The slider to adjust the similarity between the seed phrases and the generated phrases is located in the testing panel, which offers specialized features for testing the utterances generated by the first panel.

- **Test Execution**: Pressing the "Start Testing" button in the testing panel initiates the tests. It's important not to close the panel during testing; a loading notification will appear to indicate the progress of the tests. Visual Studio Code must not be closed while tests are running.

## Generated Files

In the `tmp` folder created by the extension, which will be found in the workspace, you can find the following files:

- `input.json`: Contains the selected seeds.
- `output.json`: Contains all the generated utterances.
- `simulation_results.json`: Contains the results obtained directly from the AWS CLI, which must be correctly configured with your Amazon Developer account, and the skill to be tested must have been previously deployed.
- `test_summary.txt`: Provides all the most important information on how the tests went.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JRE 8**: Java JRE 8 is required for the extension to function. Make sure it is installed and configured on your system.
- **Node.js**: Node.js is necessary for managing the extension's dependencies and running the build process. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
